# vampire-survivor-game
Description:
The game is set in a single environment - a dark and eerie forest overrun by vampires. The player controls a character armed with a gun, tasked with shooting down approaching vampires. If any vampire reaches the player, it's game over.

Key Features:

Single Environment: The entire game takes place within the forest setting, simplifying level design.
Player Character: The player controls a character equipped with a gun, which they can aim and shoot to fend off vampires.
Vampire Enemies: Vampires emerge from different directions within the forest and slowly approach the player. The player must shoot them down before they get too close.
Game Over Condition: If any vampire reaches the player, the game ends, and the player's score is displayed.
Scoring System: The player earns points for each vampire they shoot down. The longer they survive, the higher their score.
